Hi, I'm Victor. I'm a 3rd year S.M./Ph.D. student working with [Daniel Sanchez](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/)
at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/).
My primary work is in [the Swarm project](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/pervasive-parallelism-swarm-architecture),
which seeks to build new abstractions between hardware and software
that make it as easy to exploit multicore parallelism
as it is to write ordinary sequential programs.
My work spans microarchitectures, compilers, and applications.
I seek to redefine the roles of hardware and software,
not only to make it easier to scale workloads where parallelization
is expensive and error-prone today,
but also to make it practical to scale workloads where
today's systems cannot scale at all.
